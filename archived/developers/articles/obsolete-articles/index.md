#### Version Control Add-In Brainstorming

[Read Article](/archived/developers/articles/obsolete-articles/version-control-add-in-brainstorming/). Rubens Ramos has created a basic version control framework add-in for MonoDevelop called VersionControl. It is in the very early stages of development and as such there is no actual version control functionality as of yet. Such functionality will actually be provided by add-ins interfacing with the various version control libraries that VersionControl will support. This article explains some ideas about this topic.

#### Writing an Add-In

[Read Article](/archived/developers/articles/obsolete-articles/writing-an-add-in/). MonoDevelop (and SharpDevelop) have been written so that they can be easily extended by others. This can be accomplished by doing two simple things. First, by creating an assembly (.dll) containing the code for your add-in. Second, providing an .addin XML file that maps your code into MonoDevelop. This is intended as a simple and quick overview.

#### Walk through: Creating a WWW search AddIn (plugin) for MonoDevelop

[Read Article](/archived/developers/articles/obsolete-articles/creating-a-www-search-addin/). The goal of this project is to create a AddIn which search for a selected term on the web by opening a web-view in MonoDevelop and exploring the MonoDevelop AddIn system while doing so.

[Read article](/archived/developers/articles/obsolete-articles/source-map/). Sometimes it can be hard to find your way around the MonoDevelop source tree. This is intended as a brief description on where and what things are, and a couple of tips to find things. Beware that MonoDevelop is in heavy active development and things can and do change rapidly.
